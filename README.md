# Movie-Review-Nearest-Neighbor
A program that stores this data using a 20 array. Based on this information your program should allow the user to enter ratings for any three movies. The program should then find the reviewer whose ratings most closely match the ratings input by the user. It should then predict the user's interest in the other movies by outputting the ratings by the reviewer for the movies that were not rated by the user.
